# Cigna Coding Sample Project

Create a web app (React or Angular based) and Nodejs API (Use framework of choice your choosing) to displays the provided dataset and which meets the following requirements:
-	Utilize github as your repo source. We will be cloning your repo to get the application to work locally to check out your work.
-	Include launch instructions in your repo to include any installation of dependencies.
-	Include unit tests and ensure they pass.
-	The primary UI component should display the data in an organized way. This could be in the form of a table, a list, or whatever you think makes sense.
-	Provide a search form that filters the displayed data based on the search query. The search criteria will filter the displayed data based on any of the properties of the data. That part is up to you.
-	The API should contain at least one route for retrieving the data set and allowing for searching with query params sent from the web app.
-	Use multiple commits in your work to separate out
